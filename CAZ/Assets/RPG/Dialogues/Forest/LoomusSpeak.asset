  dialogueInfo:
  - name: 
    text: As you finally approach the end of the forest, the soft ground beneath
      your feet becomes uneven and rocky. The stone arch appears to tower before
      you eerily.
  - name: 
    text: The mouth of a harsh-looking cave decorated with some vegetation surrounds
      the arch, and you take one uneasy look into the pitch blackness.
  - name: Your Thoughts
    text: I can't tell which is worse... A twisty forest of trees, or a jagged lightless
      cave.
  - name: Your Thoughts
    text: Oh well, I have gotten this far, I can't stop now.
  - name: Unknown Creature
    text: Llloooooooooooooohhhhhh!
  - name: 
    text: A melodic voice pierces through the trees behind you, and you turn around
      just in time to shield your face from a blast of harsh wind!
  - name: 
    text: As the wind dies down, you witness a creature emerging from the trees,
      full of elegance and grace. It's leaf-like arms swaying above the ground as
      if to care for the small vegetation growing there.
  - name: Loomus
    text: Name is Loomus. Guardian of this forest... Human... I can not let you pass.
      You have treaded upon these grounds long enough.
  - name: 
    text: You see the anger within the creature's expression and decide to just sprint
      towards the cave, but as you turn around you realize large vines have grown
      to block your way!
  - name: 
    text: In the next instant, you find yourself surrounded by a field of blooming
      flowers of various sizes and colors. Speckles of color dance through the air
      as the creature walks towards you.
  - name: Loomus
    text: Disrespect. Danger. You humans never learn. No matter how my companions
      try to warn. Fine. Then I shall do it myself. Be prepared to face consequences
      human!
  - name: 
    text: You grab your deck of cards. Loomus' voice echoes through the air, and
      suddenly you are surrounded by various creatures! It is time to battle!
