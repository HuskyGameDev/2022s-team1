    text: After proving yourself to Loomus, she bows low towards you in respect,
      the gem on her head shimmering in the sunlight. The vines covering the stone
      arch slowly pull away.
  - name: Loomus
    text: I judged and underestimated you... I greatly apologize... It's not safe,
      I can feel it... Within leaves of nature herself. He seems more disturbed...
      I refused to let anyone past.
  - name: Loomus
    text: You...
  - name: Loomus
    text: I shall make exception...
  - name: Loomus
    text: My powers, I shall grant to you. You want to protect as well... Correct?
      Then we shall go. To the source... To him. Together. We can protect one another.
  - name: 
    text: You walk with Loomus past the stone arch into the cave. The field of blooming
      flowers left in the wake of your battle lingering and shimmering in farewell.
