  dialogueInfo:
  - name: 
    text: You find what appears to be a rock, but this is no ordinary rock. You swear
      it wasn't here before, but you get a close look.
  - name: 
    text: There's clearly some kind of writing here. Though clearly not one done
      by a human like yourself.
  - name: 
    text: Safe to assume it's the Journal of Ashix. Judging by it's location to the
      castle gate. The one the Flamzar guarded. You investigate his awful writing.
  - name: Ashix
    text: '"The removal of the monarch holding rule over the castle was a good change
      for myself, and the others living in the cave.'
  - name: Ashix
    text: 'Humans like him brought misery to others like myself the moment we made
      ourselves known to them. '
  - name: Ashix
    text: But I can't help but remain concerned for the one in the castle that took
      his place.
  - name: Ashix
    text: Concerned not so much about him, but what he plans to do with his newfound
      control over it. And the tower.
  - name: Ashix
    text: I don't even know what he says half the time, nevermind if he's spouting
      plans of destruction upon me and my fellow kin in the cave.
  - name: Ashix
    text: I guess I'm just concerned is all. I saw him only once and I listened to
      his request. Keep humans away, he says...
  - name: Ashix
    text: And who am I to deny his request upon keeping those that nearly wiped my
      own race clean from existence thanks to that rotten monarch from before?
  - name: Ashix
    text: I would check on him, see if there's something wrong in the castle. Since
      he said he would be back more than a day ago, and yet-
  - name: 
    text: There appears to be scribbles, indicating a sudden stop to his writing
      before it abruptly continues.
  - name: Ashix
    text: That was a human alright, but he was coming from the castle. I dunno if
      that counts, but I chased them off regardless.
  - name: 
    text: It seems to end there, with the rock just looping the same text again.
      Perhaps more of his rocks can be found around here?
