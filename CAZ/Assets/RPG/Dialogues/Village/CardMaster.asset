  - name: Card Master
    text: Why? 'cuz I'm good at cards that's why!
  - name: Card Master
    text: Anyway let me tell you a bit about these here cards.
  - name: Card Master
    text: Each player has a deck that they can build by pressing the button in the
      bottom left corner of their screen.
  - name: Card Master
    text: You can zoom in on a card anytime by right-clicking one.
  - name: Card Master
    text: Once a battle starts, each deck is shuffled and then the first player draws
      until their hand is full with cards.
  - name: Card Master
    text: There are three types of cards.
  - name: Card Master
    text: Creature.
  - name: Card Master
    text: Effect.
  - name: Card Master
    text: And Boss.
  - name: Card Master
    text: Creature cards have an attack and defense score. You can summon them in
      the right three zones on the field.
  - name: Card Master
    text: Once a creature is summoned, they become summon sick for the rest of the
      turn and cannot attack.
  - name: Card Master
    text: A creature can destroy an opponent's creature if it's attack score is greater
      than the other's defense score.
  - name: Card Master
    text: If they're equal, the attacking creature becomes wounded, and both are
      destoryed. The wounded creature is destroyed at the end of the turn.
  - name: Card Master
    text: You can deal damage to your opponent by attacking a Creature Zone directly.
  - name: Card Master
    text: Although, do keep in mind that you can only attack directly if your opponent
      has no creatures on the field.
  - name: Card Master
    text: Effect cards are played in the leftmost field zone and immediatley trigger
      their effect.
  - name: Card Master
    text: Effect cards are powerful, so I'd recommend finding as many as you can.
      It's up to you how you work them into your deck though.
  - name: Card Master
    text: Finally, Boss cards are powerful monsters.
  - name: Card Master
    text: Legend says once upon a time, these Boss creatures were the interest of
      a Zoologist who sought them out in the name of research.
  - name: Card Master
    text: Anyway, I'm not sure if these legends are true...
  - name: Card Master
    text: But if you come across a Boss card, be sure to keep a copy of it in your
      deck.
  - name: Card Master
    text: Oh, and you can also discard cards by dragging them into the Discard Zone
      to the left of the field.
  - name: Card Master
    text: Additionally, you can see the creatures that have been destroyed by clicking
      either discard pile button around the Discard Zone.
  - name: Card Master
    text: You are allowed 5 copies of each Creature card, 3 copies of each Effect
      card, and 1 copy of each Boss card in your deck.
  - name: Card Master
    text: A player wins by either dropping their opponent's HP to zero, or making
      their enemy run out of cards in their deck.
  - name: Card Master
    text: If you have no cards to draw on the start of your turn, it's game over.
  - name: Card Master
    text: Oh, and you need a deck of at least 3 cards. If you have a deck with less
      than 3 cards when a battle starts, you lose.
  - name: Card Master
    text: By the way, if your opponent is taking too long on their turn, you can
      hold 'Z' on your keyboard to speed up combat.
  - name: Card Master
    text: Also, the closer you get to that ancient castle, the more powerful the
      cards become...
  - name: Card Master
    text: Something about ancient magics and some zoo that the old king kept on the
      grounds.
  - name: Card Master
    text: Something happened recently though, creatures are running amuck and the
      townsfolk are scared half to death.
  - name: Card Master
    text: ... But me?
  - name: Card Master
    text: I just keep my head down and my heart in the cards.
  - name: Card Master
    text: Cya around.
