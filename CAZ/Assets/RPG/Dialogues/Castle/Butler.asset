  - name: Undead Butler
    text: Unfortunately, my master has been driven from this castle, and I am thus
      unable to provide you with the hospitality required for a guest, my sincerest
      apologies.
  - name: Undead Butler
    text: I believe the new master would like to see you, it is, however, quite difficult
      to understand him.
  - name: Undead Butler
    text: I'd personally suggest looking around a bit before going in, sir.  Many
      things have been misplaced out here that you may find useful.
