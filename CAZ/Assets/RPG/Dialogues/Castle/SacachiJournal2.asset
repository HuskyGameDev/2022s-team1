  - name: Unknown Writer
    text: Perhaps someday I can do something for them in return...
  - name: Unknown Writer
    text: As well as regain my memories...
  - name: 
    text: The long passage ends, with other squiggles and potential words written
      below... But you can't read or understand them.
