    text: Alright, everyone is asleep, lets get this over with.
  - name: Mysterious Voice 1
    text: Hmmm. . .
  - name: Kazi's Voice
    text: Iki? Are we doing this or not?
  - name: Iki's Voice
    text: The magic levels. . .perhaps. . .hopefully it'll work. . . I don't know,
      I feel like I'm missing something. . .
  - name: Iki's Voice
    text: Oh well! It should be fine if my calculations are correct! Either way,

      is theorectically immortal.

  - name: Iki's Voice
    text: Anyways! Let's get to the dimensional banishing shall we?
  - name: Kazi's Voice
    text: You know what? I'm too tired to continue to question your babble. Finally,
      let's go.
  - name: 
    text: The recording abruptly ends.
