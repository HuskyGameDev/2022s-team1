      My friends... this world... ... I have found myself now sitting on a throne...'
  - name: Unknown Writer
    text: ... The words of my friends swirl in my head... Of how humans hurt them...
      How much both sides have to fight... I want to change that... Yet how... When
      I struggle to speak... And no personal experience within the world they live
      in?
  - name: Unknown Writer
    text: I must find a way... ... These markings stop me... But not for long...
      I can feel them struggle... I should lock myself away... Until I can control
      myself... Yet despite my wishes...
  - name: Unknown Writer
    text: Destruction is ingrained within my soul."
