  - name: 
    text: It's a book held with a leather cover, placed carefully upon the shelf.
      It looks so new and clean compared to the others, so you decide to take a closer
      look...
  - name: 
    text: The words written on the pages look organized and formed in neat cursive.
      The whole thing feels really fancy.
  - name: Your Thoughts
    text: Perhaps this was a journal one of the people living in the castle wrote
      in?
  - name: Unknown Writer
    text: '"When I awoke, all I could see was an abyss, detached from the world.
      I wandered within it, confused, anxious, and lonely. My memories foggy and
      lost.'
  - name: Unknown Writer
    text: Eventually I found a door, just as misplaced as I felt, and I opened it
      to see a throne room almost just as dark as the abyss I walked around in. Empty
      and lifeless.
  - name: Unknown Writer
    text: I had shuddered then, for an instinctual fear had come over me. One I still
      can not fully comprehend or understand... Yet when I close my eyes, the dancing
      memory of screams and utter destruction envelope me...
  - name: Unknown Writer
    text: That image, that fear... Made me shelter myself a little longer into the
      abyss.
  - name: Unknown Writer
    text: When I finally did leave, my whole body shook and I looked around desparately
      until I found a table. It held a singular plate, as if it was placed there
      just for me...
  - name: Unknown Writer
    text: Am I... supposed to be here?
  - name: Unknown Writer
    text: The curious part of me yearns to see, to explore. Yet the rational, more
      ingrained part of me knows I should lock myself away.
  - name: Unknown Writer
    text: 'Thus, all I was able to accomplish afterwards was to find this blank book
      and a pen. Placed right near the entryway to this throne room... Yet again
      seemingly another action to suggest I should belong here. '
  - name: Unknown Writer
    text: Nothing else reflects that though... The walls buzz, as if struggling to
      hold themselves. The lights flicker unhappily if I go near them... And there
      are odd chitters and sounds outside of the throne room.
  - name: Unknown Writer
    text: I am not sure what to do...
  - name: Unknown Writer
    text: But perhaps writing about it will help me piece it together.
  - name: Unknown Writer
    text: To remember."
  - name: 
    text: The long passage ends, and you shiver. Something about this writing feels
      off. Causing you to have doubts...
  - name: Your Thoughts
    text: Did another human even write this?
