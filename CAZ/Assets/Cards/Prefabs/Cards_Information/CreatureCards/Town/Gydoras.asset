  description: A purple and gray bird-like creature that has sharp claws at the end
    of its wings.  Often lands upon people's rooftops during the early morning, early
    afternoon, and late night to chirp and twitter in order to tease them or to signify
    the time.  It can be a picky creature, and is often rebellious towards anyone
    who tries to tame it.  Although it is also a very loyal companion once its trust
    is earned.
