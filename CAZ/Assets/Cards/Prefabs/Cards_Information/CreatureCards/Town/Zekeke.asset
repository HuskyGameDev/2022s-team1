  description: Enjoys dark crannies and chilling in buckets of water, coming out
    at night to run about the town with the ends of its tail orbs glowing a bright
    yellow.  Originally the glow was used to scare off other creatures, but people
    from town often use them to help find thier way back into town at night.  Usually
    curious, it is very common for one to be watching from afar, following a person's
    movements as it attempts to learn something new.Enjoys dark crannies and chilling
