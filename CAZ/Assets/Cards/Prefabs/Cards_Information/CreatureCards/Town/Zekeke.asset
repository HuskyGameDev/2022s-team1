  description: A greenish colored critter that enjoys dark crannies and chilling
    in buckets of water.  It often comes out at night to run about the town with
    the ends of its antenna and tails glowing a bright yellow.  Originally its glowing
    tail orbs were used to scare off other creatures, but people of the town often
    use them to help find thier way back into town if it is dark outside.  Usually
    curious, it is very common for one to be watching from afar, following a person's
    movements as it attempts to learn something new.
