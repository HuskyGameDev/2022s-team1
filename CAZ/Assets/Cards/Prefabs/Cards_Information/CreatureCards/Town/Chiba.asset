  description: Small orange plant creature from the forest that really likes eating
    sap and sweets.  It often wanders into town to steal food or act cute in hope
    to gain sweets or some shelter.  Otherwise, it is a docile creature that if spoiled
    enough, may help around the town keeping it clean and helping plants grow.
