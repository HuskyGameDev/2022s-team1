  description: A wingless dragon-like creature who surrounds itself with minerals
    that eventually after long enough, will become a part of its scales.  It is a
    heavy and slow paced creature that uses its bulk to plow new tunnels and areas
    into the cave walls.  Using the debris from its digging to create new walls or
    blockades, this creature seems to be the origin that causes the cave to shift
    like a labyrinth.  Its spikes, sharp teeth, and sturdy metal body make it seem
    quite vicious, but is more of a patient creature that is only protective over
    the minerals it will collect and carry with it.
