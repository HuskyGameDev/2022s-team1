  description: 'A large gray furred dragon-bat, with a white skull and glowing red
    eyes.  It is often a soloist creature, preferring to settle far away from others
    of its kind.  The movements it makes are silent and graceful, almost seeming
    invisible unless it wants to be found.  If it deems someone worthy, it will act
    as a guild and protector to them.  Its rumored it is also a guild into the afterlife,
    as it often surrounds humans who are hurt or sick within thier vicinity.  Lately
    the hums they sing throughout the cave feel disturbing.  As though to warn those
    who wander in of a great disturbance. '
