  description: A lizard-like upright demon whose head is its skull surrounded by
    flames. The flames will change color and intensity depending on its emotions,
    leading to many humans misinterpretting and fearing it.  It is usually found
    in the cave's darkest depths, although lately it has been too stubborn to budge
    from its position at end of the cave.  A smaller creature compared to others,
    as a guardian it stands before everyone with firey pride and authority, with
    its eye sockets reflecting great intelligence.  Like Loomus, it seems agitated
    as well, leading to the cave feeling more foritfied and dangerous than ever before. 
    It is really determined to let no one walk outside to the other end of the cave.
