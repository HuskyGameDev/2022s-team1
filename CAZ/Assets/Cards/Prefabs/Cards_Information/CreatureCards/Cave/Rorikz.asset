  description: Small spider critter with only four legs and three eyes.  Hanging
    from the cave walls, it will pounce and glide down using the webbing between
    its back legs to envlope the prey it spotted from its hiding place.  More often
    than not, it will mistake a human for food and come gliding down to land directly
    on the human's head to try and nibble them.  Its eyes can move independently
    from each other, but are also short-sighted.  The horn on top of its head is
    used to make its prey fall asleep with the special venom inside of it.
  effect: None
