  description: Psychic biblical angel inspired fluff with third eye.  It often hides
    near nooks and crannies of the cave, watching passerby and giving them hallucinations
    if it feels they aren't getting lost enough.  Usually the first thing people
    will see are its beady eyes in the dark, staring at them as they struggle to
    find thier way through the pitch dark places of the cave.  It is said its third
    eye can see the future, but that has yet to be proven, and the creature itself
    is too rebellious to share with anyone who tames it the whole truth.
  effect: None
