  description: A 200+ year old demon who has somehow found himself trapped within
    the castle of a world he is not familiar with.  Despite his confusion, he feels
    very connected to the creatures of this world, and he often finds himself attempting
    to play with the creatures in the castle.  He barely speaks, and loves to look
    out the window of the castle, hoping to one day figure out why he was brought
    here and perhaps see the rest of the world.  Yet, as he hears of a certain human
    approaching the castle, he starts feeling anxious as they start to tame all of
    his critter friends.  Afraid that he will be left alone in the castle forever
    without anyone by his side to keep him company.  Thus, the seal on his body breaks
    in his agitation, causing Sacachi to realize the kind of power he holds, and
    why the creatures of this world had been so wary of his presence in the first
    place.
