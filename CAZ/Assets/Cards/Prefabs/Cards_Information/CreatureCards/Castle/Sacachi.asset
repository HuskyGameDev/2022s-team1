  description: 200+ year old demon who found himself trapped within the castle of
    a unfamiliar world.  Despite his confusion, he feels connected to the creatures
    of this world, and often trys to play with the creatures in the castle.  He barely
    speaks, and loves to look out the window, hoping to one day find why he was brought
    here and see the rest of the world.  Yet, as he hears of a human approaching
    the castle, he starts feeling anxious.  Thus, the seal on his body breaks, causing
    Sacachi to realize what power he holds, and why the creatures of this world were
    so wary of his presence.
