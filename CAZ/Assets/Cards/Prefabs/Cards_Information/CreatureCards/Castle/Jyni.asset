  description: A blueish fluff that stays in the dark corners of the castle who is
    also unable to see well except for in the dark.  Acutely alert of all the presences
    near it, it is highly skittish and prefers to run away or battle from a safe
    distance.  If it chooses to attack, it will use its psychic powers to pick up
    sharp objects in the castle and hurl it, while using more sturdy materials to
    build a shield around itself.
