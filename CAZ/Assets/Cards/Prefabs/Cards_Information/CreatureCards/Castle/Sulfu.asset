  description: A ghost looking critter that is often said to float away from the
    castle to hang around graves and respectfully tidy up the area around them. 
    Usually found in clusters with other Sulfu, frantically whispering to each other
    in a language no human can understand.  It has a friendly disposition, although
    it is insistant on getting in the way, trying to distract people with picked
    flowers and an assortment of other random gifts it has found.  If its gift is
    disrespected it will lose its patience and angrily circle around the person until
    they decide to do something about it.
