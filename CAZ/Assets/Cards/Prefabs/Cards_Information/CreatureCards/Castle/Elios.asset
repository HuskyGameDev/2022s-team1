  description: A white scaled, dragon-eel that loves discharging electricity and
    days with rainy thunderstorms.  Sometimes on cloudy days it will rest on the
    roof of the castle and shoot beams of electricity into the sky, hoping for a
    storm.  Its scales shine so bright that long ago people mistook them as angelic
    beings.  It isn't afraid of a good battle and often challenges Nocto if it feels
    bored.  Lately a whole group of them are floating near the top of the castle,
    trying to protect something, or perhaps even keep something in.
