  description: A firey armadillo-dragon that will proudly swoop down from the top
    floors of the castle in order to challenge any newcomers.  Secretly it likes
    cuddles and head pats, but it is too proud of a creature to fully admit it. 
    It often sunbathes by sitting on the window sills of the castle, and tries to
    imitate the sun's heat in battle by spreading its flames near the floor to warm
    the room to a terrifying degree.  Recently it has taken extra effort to train
    and come off as a threat, mainly by curling up in a ball and bouncing around
    the castle, causing dents in the walls.
