  description: A plant-like being that is revered by people and creatures alike as
    the guardian of the forest.  Wherever it stands, beautiful flowers will bloom
    and small sparkles of rainbow will glimmer in the light surrounding it.  The
    leaf-like arms it has can be used to whip up powerful gusts of air that can be
    mistaken for a storm within the trees.  It is often docile or tame unless a human
    bothers a creature near it, or steps onto the flowers it has created to bloom. 
    Lately it has come off as very agitated, causing the other creatures living within
    the forest to be on alert.
