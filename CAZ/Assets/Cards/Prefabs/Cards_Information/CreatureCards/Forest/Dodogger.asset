  description: Dog-like plant creature that is known to be able to grow small carrots
    on its back.  Quite friendly towards other fellow creatures, it is usually found
    socializing with those creatures of the forest and tending to them by sharing
    a carrot from its back.  Although it can be very territorial and skeptical towards
    human passerby.  Before attacking, it will bellow a loud howl that will echo
    across the forest, once this sound is heard it is best to be prepared for a fight.
