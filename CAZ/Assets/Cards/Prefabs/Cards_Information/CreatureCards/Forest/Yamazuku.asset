  description: Small creature that is mainly just a beaked head with small bird-like
    legs that it waddles around on.  It likes to poke at the pebbles on the ground,
    yet because its body is so much larger, it will often fall head first into the
    dirt instead.  This makes it often a quick tempered little critter, and it will
    run around the forest trying to prove its strength to anyone it runs into.  If
    victorious it will trill loudly after battle, if not it will simply waddle away
    in shame to go back to pecking at pebbles in the ground.
