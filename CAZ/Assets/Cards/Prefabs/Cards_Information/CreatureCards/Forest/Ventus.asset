  description: Plant dinosaur that has a venus flytrap tail, it likes playing amongst
    the flowers and tricking passerby with its tail which is often mistaken as its
    head.  It mainly eats any bugs that pass by it and is often known to just chill
    in one certain spot.  Although it can move at a surprisingly fast speed when
    it wants to, especially if it smells something strong or spots something 'pretty'
    it would like to laze about next to.
